# Cewi/Excel plugin for CakePHP

! Not  Ready For Production !

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

add 

    "repositories": [
             {
                "type": "vcs",
                "url": "https://github.com/cewi/excel"
            }
        ] 
        
 to your composer.json because this package is not on packagist. Then in your console:

```
composer require Cewi/Excel
```

should fetch the plugin.
